I am a sociologist, an Assistant Professor of Sociology at [ENSAE](https://ensae.fr) and a researcher at [Crest](https://crest.science) in the [CSS research group](https://www.css.cnrs.fr/) in Palaiseau, France. Before this, I earned a PhD in Sociology from ENS Lyon in 2016, and then worked for five years as a digital researcher at telecommunication company Orange in Paris.

I work on cultural consumption, cultural inequalities, and digital culture, using computational social science and mixed methods. I have studied museum visitors, video game players, Twitch and Twitter influencers, digital advertisers, and users of streaming platforms.

My main current research project is [Records](https://records.huma-num.fr/), a collective endeavour with music streaming platform Deezer to look at digital music consumption using log data, surveys and interviews. In the project, I use detailed consumption data to take a new look at cultural inequalities; I also study the uses of recommendation algorithms and the way users come to adopt new music.
