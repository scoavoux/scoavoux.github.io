Samuel Coavoux is a sociologist, currently working as an Assistant Professor of Sociology at [ENSAE](https://ensae.fr) and as a researcher at [Crest](https://crest.science) in the [CSS research group](https://www.css.cnrs.fr/) in Palaiseau, France. Before this, he earned a PhD in Sociology from ENS Lyon in 2016, and then worked for five years as a digital researcher at telecommunication company Orange in Paris.

He works on cultural consumption, cultural inequalities, and digital culture, using computational social science and mixed methods. He has studied museum visitors, video game players, Twitch and Twitter influencers, digital advertisers, and users of streaming platforms.

His main current research project is [Records](https://records.huma-num.fr/), a collective endeavour with music streaming platform Deezer to look at digital music consumption using log data, surveys and interviews. In the project, Samuel uses detailed consumption data to take a new look at cultural inequalities; he also studies the uses of recommendation algorithms and the way users come to adopt new music.
